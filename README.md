# Decoding IPL: Match Analysis

Our project has two aims. 
1. Predict the
outcome of matches, i.e. the winner of the match, based
on previous yearsâ€™ data. 
2. Predict the
scores during certain intervals of the game. For example,
the score in overs 1-15, 1-10 or 3-8 etc.

To accomplish this, algorithms such as Decision Trees, Linear
Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines
have been used.

The file structure is as follows:

1. **Dataset/**: This directory contains all the data files, stored weights and the embedding matrix. 
    1. **Dataset/Embeddings/**: Contains the embedding matrix 
        1. **emb_player_vec_dict**: contains the embedding matrix and vector information.
        2. **emb_player_stoi_dict**: contains the string to index information for player names.
        3. **del_to_emb_final**: stores the mapping of player names from deliveries.csv to embedding matrix.
        4. **emb_player_vec_dict**: stores the embedding vector player_name wise.
        5. **not_found**: contains the list of players who had different names in both the datasets.
    2. **Dataset/cricksheet_ipl_csv**: Data collected from [Cricsheet's website](https://cricsheet.org/) in .csv format.
    3. **Dataset/cricsheet_ipl_yaml**:  Data collected from [Cricsheet's website](https://cricsheet.org/) in .yaml format.  
    4. **Dataset/ipl_stats**: Data scraped from the [IPL's official website](https://www.iplt20.com/) for season wise player points.
    5. **Dataset/kaggle_data**: contains matches.csv (match-wise information about every IPL season from 2008 to 2020) and deliveries.csv (delivery-wise information about every IPL match).
    6. **Dataset/Ball_by_ball.csv**: contains modified deliveries.csv with 7-dimensional vectors instead of player names.

2. **Reports/**: 
    1. **Project_Presentation.pptx**: Project presentation
    2. **Project_Report.pdf**: A detailed project report

3. **plots/**: Folder containing plots created during Exploratory Data Analysis.

4. **Ball_by_Ball_Regression.ipynb**: Code to perform regression on ball-by-ball dataset. It predicts the score for each ball.

5. **Create_ball_by_ball_dataset.ipynb**: Converts the categorized features (batsman, non-striker and bowler) in deliveries.csv into their corresponding vectors.

6. **Create_variable_balls_dataset.ipynb**: Groups together variable number of balls from the deliveries.csv.

7. **EDA.ipynb**: Contains the Exploratory Data Analysis performed on the collected data. 

8. **HyperparameterTuning_Regression.ipynb**: Regression based models with hyperparameter tuning for the best model.

9. **Player_Embedding_Vectors.ipynb**: Creates player embeddings based on the player-wise performance scraped from IPL's official website.

10. **match_classification.ipynb**: Classification models with hyperparameter tuning for the match result prediction task.
